'''

try:
    if len(input('Enter the number: '))==4:
        print('Correct length')

user_id = 'amin'
password = 'amin_1122'
count = 0
user_id1= input('Enter username: ')
while count < 3:
    if user_id1 == user_id:
        password1 = input('Enter password: ')

6. Read doc.txt file using Python File handling concept and return only the even length string from

Hello I am a file
Where you need to return the data string
Which is of even length
Make sure you return the content in The same link as it is present.
